		<p>As of now, we are all done with the COVID-19 resrictions, and while some aspects of life are different now,many things went back to how they used to be. I am still playing hockey, but am in my last year of it as a senior in high school. I am planning on atending Lansing Community College in the fall semester, to pursue a business degree.
