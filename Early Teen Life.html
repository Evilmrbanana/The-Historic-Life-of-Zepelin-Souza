		<p> While figuring out my early teenage life, I was still playing hockey, as well as navigating the crazy time of life of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a crazy part of my life, with everything, including school shutting down for so long, as well as even hockey being restricted and wearing masks for a long time afterward. This heavily impacted my life from having to spend a lot of time indoors instead of being outside, to not being able to go visit my grandparents for risk of spreading COVID-19.<p>
