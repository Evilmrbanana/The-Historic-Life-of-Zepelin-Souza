		<p> As a kid I was still playing the sport I loved, as well as always hanging out with my brothers and the rest of my family. My brothers and I were besically insperable when we were together. We would mess around, go play basketball in the street, or playing video games all day during the summertime. I spent a lot of my free time with them.<p>
