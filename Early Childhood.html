		<p> As a young chap, I was always getting into trouble and trying to hurt myself. I was also invested into many different sports as a young child and would be playing multiple sports at a time, going from one practice to another. This all stopped when my grandpa bought me lessons for ice skating and I started to play hockey. When i put that stick in my hand it was like love at first sight, and i never stopped playing hockey since.</p>
